# Notes
The code in `main.ipynb` is all the code used for the report in its entirety. Markdown cells inside the notebook provide an overview and structure of the notebook, and most cells also have a docstring briefly explaining the purpose and contents of the cells.

The very first Python cell contains several flags related to enabling certain parts of the code, if the code is to be run, please read the comments left in this cell.

### Installation
The code has been tested on Windows 11 using Python version 3.12.1, and on Ubuntu 22.04.4 using Python version 3.10.12
The `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries necessary to run the code, not including the libraries necessary for running a Jupyter file.
